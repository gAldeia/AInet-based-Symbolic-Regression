AInet Symbolic Regression
=====


Haskell implementation of a symbolic regression algorithm. The regression search is done by means of the IT data structure, and the general structure of the algorithm is based on the AInet algorithm (artificial imunne network).

The regression is done by creating a random population of solutions, where each solution is a linear combination of IT terms. Then, for a given number of generations, the algorithm performs a symbolic regression inspired by the biological immune system.

## The IT (Interaction-Transformation) data structure

## The AInet algorithm

# Source files

The main project is within the SymbolicRegression folder. There are 4 modules that compose the algorithm:

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Dataset.hs | Description goes here |
| Manipulators.hs | Description goes here |
| AInet.hs | Description goes here |
| Main.hs | Main file, containing an example of how to use the algorithm and our recomended parameters to run it.|
